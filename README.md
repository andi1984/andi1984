## Hi there 👋

My name is Andreas (shorthand Andi). I'm working on the web since 2013, located in south-west Germany.

Within my Github repos you will find a variety of frontend projects like [my own static site generator](https://github.com/andi1984/back2roots), VSCode extensions like [VSCode TinyPNG](https://github.com/andi1984/vscode-tinypng) or [little, funny side-projects](https://emojisocket.herokuapp.com/) done within my weekly [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/andi1984).

### Side Projects

- 🎒️ Mentoring on a local [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo-saar.de/) event
- 👨‍💻️ [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/andi198) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9yhSlXfpjleDuJV1AGViIg)
